Pick a theme: NBA player names

The game should have a library of nba player names and randomly select  one each time the game starts. This can be an array with a random number generator.

The game should show how many letters are in this name as "_ _ _ _" This can be an array with as many "_" as there are letters in the random players word. 

Players will start the game by using a key press

The user's guess will be stored and it will be compared against all letters in the player array. if any match they need to change to something like "B _ _ _ _ _"

Any letters guessed will be added to another array and the guesses left number will decrease from 12 for any new letters

I will need to check if the user wins or loses after most key presses. These can be functions that I call. 

I'll update a set of counters depending on letters played, wins, losses etc...

I'll display facts about the player after a win.
